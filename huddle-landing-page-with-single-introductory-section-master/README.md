## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project was an opportunity for me to add icons to my web page using the Font Awesome library.

Below are some lines oh my HTML code:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/7.0.1/css/all.min.css">
```
```html
div class="social__icons__container">
      <span class="icon">
        <i class="fa-brands fa-facebook-f"></i>
      </span>
      <span class="icon">
        <i class="fa-brands fa-twitter"></i>
      </span>
      <span class="icon">
        <i class="fa-brands fa-instagram"></i>
      </span>
</div>
```

### Continued development

I would like to get at writing cleanm reusable and accessibile code. I would also like to learn how to structure HTML code correctly with semantics.
