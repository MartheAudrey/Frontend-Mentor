## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to select the last anchor element among the direct children of an element.

```css
button a,
.content__container > a:last-of-type{
    text-decoration: none;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like feedback on my HTML structure and learn more on accessibility.
